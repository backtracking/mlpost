o - changes in behaviour, new features, bugfixes
* - incompatible changes in the interface

current
-------
o concrete computations are now available without the Cairo library
o option -ps with -cairo
o adding Concrete.baseline
o module Color: the definitions of the following colors have changed:
  lightblue, green, lightgreen, orange, lightcyan, purple, lightyellow
  These colors are now compatible to HTML/CSS and X11 definitions
o Fixed "make install" with ocamlfind (reported by Julien Signoles)

current stable
--------------
o fixed bug #411: correct definition of objects used in Path.subpath
o metapost errors are printed (this should rarely occur)


version 0.7.4, October 20th, 2009
--------------------------------
o Mlpost tool : Fix compilation with ocamlbuild

version 0.7.3, October 13th, 2009
--------------------------------
o Fix installation without ocamlfind and without ocamlbuild

version 0.7.2, October 9th, 2009
--------------------------------
* -classic-display is not an option of mlpost tool anymore (use -v instead)
* Change in the signature of Cairost.emit_cairo
o Fix the -compile-name option with ocamlbuild
o ocamlfind remove/install is used if ocamlfind is present
o The backend Concrete output informations only with the verbose option
o Radar: fixed size of bullets
o Helpers: the functions for boxes have a new optional argument [within] to
  give a box in which the arguments will be searched
o Box: new functions [set_{post,pre}_draw]
* Box: [get_name] now returns a string option
o Tree.Simple: alignment options for [node]
o Box: optional argument dash

version 0.7.1, July 24th, 2009
------------------------------
o Fix for Performance bug when shifting boxes

version 0.7, July 23rd, 2009
----------------------------
* add Point.draw and Path.draw (alias of Command.draw) which can mask 
  Command.draw in case of an open Point after an open Command
* Command.draw_arrow becomes Arrow.simple
* Arrow.draw: ~pos becomes ~anchor, new ~pos is point on path
* Arrow.draw: now gives the same result by default as Arrow.simple (former
  Command.draw_arrow)
* Arrow.draw2 becomes Arrow.point_to_point
* Mlpost tool: -pdf now the default; use -ps to produce .1 files
* Mlpost tool: erases all generated intermediate files on success
o New experimental backend using Cairo; it permits output in PS, PDF, SVG and
  X11; use it with commandline option -cairo. It is intended to deliver the
  same results as the old metapost backend. Please send a bug report if it is
  not the case
o A module Concrete which permits to compute concrete values of mlpost
  objects, e.g. the float value corresponding to an object of type Num.t , 
  the concrete point { x : float; y : float } corresponding to a Point.t, and
  so on
o A better tree drawing algorithm (module Tree)
o new function Tree.nodel to add labels to tree edges
o "Smart" paths to construct a path by giving only a sequence of directions
  (module Path)
o Histograms and Radar diagrams (modules Hist and Radar)
o The type Picture.t now is equal to the type Command.t 
  (no more conversion needed)
o module Box: each box has a name by default; use Box.sub to retrieve a box
  with the same name inside another
o New optional argument sep of Path.strip to strip both ends of a path; used
  in Tree, Box.cpath, and Helpers
o New position constructors `North, `South, `Upperleft to improve upon `Top, `Bot
  etc, but the old variants are still there

version 0.6, February 4th, 2009
-------------------------------
* "open Mlpost" is not added to input files any more -
  users have to add by themselves
* the type Command.figure becomes Command.t
o inclusion of external images (png, jpg etc)
o transformations on boxes
o Box.{grid,gridl,gridi}: new options hpadding, vpadding, stroke, pen
o additional options for many functions
o corrections of some small bugs in box calculations
o A function in the API to scan a TeX file for the prelude

version 0.5, Octobre 20, 2008 (first public release)
----------------------------------------------------
o new option -native to use native compilation, useful for complicated pictures

version 0.3
-----------
o new module Pos to place lists, arrays, trees
* Num.f function removed
o new commandline arguments -v, -eps
* The functions in the Shapes module now build objects of type Shapes.t
  instead of Path.t
* In Diag, one can now specify more (and different) types of boxes for nodes

version 0.2, July 22nd, 2008
----------------------------
 o Box: no more use of boxes.mp, replaced by Ocaml code
 o License: LGPL updated to version 2.1
 o Num: t is now an abstract datatype
 o Moved repository to a trunk/branches style
 o Subversion repository updated to schema version 5

version 0.1
-----------
 o first release of Mlpost
