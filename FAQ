1) When I include an MlPost Figure using \includegraphics in a PDF document,
   I get the following error: "File not found : supp-pdf.tex".

Answer:

This seems to be a bug in some old Ubuntu distributions. You need the package
"context" that contains the file "supp-pdf.tex". So an

apt-get install context

should do.
   

2) When I run the mlpost tool on my figure, I get the error "! Unable to make
mpx file.".

Answer:

This is a cryptical error message from metapost saying that there is some
error in the Latex code that is part of your figure. However, it often points
to some random Latex code, so you will have to figure out the problem by
yourself, or by looking at the "mpxerr.tex" file that has been generated.


3) When I look at generated "foo.1" or "foo.mps" file, gv/evince does
not display the figure correctly / gives some error.

Answer:

These generated files are not proper PostScript files. They need to be
included in a Latex file using \includegraphics.
