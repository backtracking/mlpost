1) When I include an MlPost Figure using \includegraphics in a PDF document,
   I get the following error: "File not found : supp-pdf.tex".

Answer:

This seems to be a bug in some old Ubuntu distributions. You need the package
"context" that contains the file "supp-pdf.tex". So an

apt-get install context

should do.
