1) When I include an MlPost Figure using \includegraphics in a PDF document,
   I get the following error: "File not found : supp-pdf.tex".

Answer:

This seems to be a bug in some old Ubuntu distributions. You need the package
"context" that contains the file "supp-pdf.tex". So an

apt-get install context

should do.
   

2) When I run the mlpost tool on my figure, I get the error "! Unable to make
mpx file.".

Answer:

This is a cryptical error message from metapost saying that there is some
error in the Latex code that is part of your figure. However, it often points
to some random Latex code, so you will have to figure out by yourself, or by
looking at the "mpxerr.tex" file that has been generated.
