Dependencies:
* You need Objective Caml 3.08.0 or higher to compile Mlpost.
* You need Objective Caml 3.10.2 or higher to compile Mlpost with cairo
  support; You also need the libraries bitstring, lablgtk2 and cairo.
  check the output of ./configure to see if cairo has been selected.
* To use Mlpost, you need metafun (package context in debian)
* For the html version of the examples, you need caml2html, version 1.3.0 or
  higher.
* One example needs the tex chess fonts to work (package tex-chess in debian)
* For external images, you need imagemagick

1. Configure with 

	./configure

If you want to specify the directory where libraries (cmi, cma, ...) will be
installed:

        ./configure LIBDIR=/your/libdir

If you want to specify the directory where the binary (mlpost) will be installed:

        ./configure --bindir=/your/bindir

2. Compile with 

	make

3. Install (as root) with

	make install

It installs the library in Ocaml's standard library and the tool "mlpost"
in /usr/local/bin (or any other directory specified with ./configure --bindir).

4 (optional)
  copy the files from the latex subdirectory at a place where latex can find
  it (see the README in that directory)

5 (optional). Create the documentation in doc/ with
        
        make doc

  and the examples in examples/ with

        make -C examples

  To create html versions of the examples, you need caml2html version 1.3.0;
  you can then issue

        make -C examples html
