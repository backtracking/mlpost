You need Objective Caml 3.08.0 or higher to compile Mlpost.

1. Configure with 

	./configure

2. Compile with 

	make

3. Install (as root) with

	make install

It installs the library in Ocaml's standard library and the tool "mlpost"
in /usr/local/bin (or any other directory specified with ./configure --bindir).
