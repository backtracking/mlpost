* You need the latest version of caml2html:
    svn checkout svn://svn.forge.ocamlcore.org/svnroot/caml2html
  To compile that, you also need camlmix, either by godi, or
    http://martin.jambon.free.fr/camlmix/

* using (*html, you can put html into the target file

* code hiding is done via (*parse. currently supported:
   <<name  - open a div with name "name" and show/hide link, defaults to hide
   >> - close the last opened div

* you can modify parse.mll if you need more than that
